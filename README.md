<ol>

 <li>Factory Pattern Add class DuckFactory to the simulator. The duck factory should handle the creation of all ducks. It will have a method called createDuck</li>

 <li>Adapter Pattern – Write an adapter called GooseDuck</li>

 <li>Observer Pattern – Use the Java Observable class and Observer interface to implement the observer pattern. The duck factory will be the subject (observable) and the duck will be the potential observers.</li>

 <li>Decorator Pattern – Add an abstract decorator class Bling to ducks. You should have 3 types of bling represented by the following classes: StarBling, MoonBling, and CrossBling.</li>
